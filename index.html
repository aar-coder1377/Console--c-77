    <p> WHAT IS A CONSOLE SCREEN</p>
    <p> A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.</p>
    <p>WHY DO WE USE A CONSOLE SCREEN</p>
    <p> Also known as a terminal or computer console, a console is a combination of a display monitor and an input device, typically a keyboard and/or mouse. It allows users to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.</p>
    <p> HOW TO OPEN A CONSOLE SCREEN</p>
    <p>Step 1: To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Ctrl +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you can right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect" to open the developer console. Step 2: Click the "Console" tab in that window.</p>
    <p> HOW TO PRINT A CONSOLE SCREEN</p>
    <p> You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>
    <script>
        console.log("my first console project");
        var firstname="Ranbir";
        console.log(firstname);
        var lastname="Kapoor";
        console.log(lastname);
        var fullname=firstname.concat(lastname);
        console.log(fullname);
        var lengthofname=fullname.length;
        console.log(lengthofname);
        var a = 10
        var b = 5
        var add = a.concat(b);
        console.log(add);
